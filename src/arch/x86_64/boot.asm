; Page tables translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. Pages
; are 4096 bytes. There are four pages tables, each with 512 8-byte
; entries:
;
; - the Page-Map Level-4 Table (PML4), or P4
; - the Page-Directory Pointer Table (PDP), or P3
; - the Page-Directory Table (PD), or P2
; - the Page Table (PT), or P1
;
; For a given 64-bit virtual address, the following happens:
; 1. Get the address of the P4 table from the CR3 register
; 2. Index the P4 table with bits 39-47 (9 bits, 2^9 == 512 == number of entries)
; 3. Index the P3 table with the next 9 bits
; 4. Index the P2 table with the next 9 bits
; 5. Index the P1 table with the next 9 bits
; 6. Use the remaining 12 bites as the page offset (2^12 == 4096 == page size)
;
; Bits 48-63 aren't used and are all identical to bit 47. They aren't
; used because it would make the available address space
; unnecessarilly large and increase the complexity and cost of address
; translation.
;
; There is always exactly one P4 table. Each P4 entry maps to a P3
; table, each P3 entry maps to a P2 table, and each P2 entry maps to a
; P1 table (512 * 512 * 512 * 512 * 4KiB pages == 2^48 bytes == 256TiB
; of virtual addressable space) Each entry contains a page aligned
; 52-bit physical address of the frame or the next page table. We need
; to identity map the virtaul address to the (identical) physical
; address. We do this by setting the present and writable bits (bits 0
; and 1) of the aligned P3 table address and move it to the first four
; (size of eax) bytes of the P4 table. We repeat for the first four
; bytes of the P3 table.

; assigning this to the ecx'th entry. Once this has been done 512
